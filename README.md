Description:

The Workout Tracker is a Python program designed to help individuals track and manage their exercise routines. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to add, view, and delete workout entries, as well as save the data to a CSV file for future reference.

The program utilizes the Nutritionix API to fetch exercise data based on user input. Users can enter the type of exercise they performed, and the program retrieves information such as the exercise duration and estimated calories burned. This data is then organized into a table and displayed to the user.

Requirements : Before running the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3
    "requests" library (can be installed via pip install requests)
    "tabulate" library (can be installed via pip install tabulate)

Getting Started:

    Clone the repository or download the code files.
    Obtain API credentials from the Nutritionix API by signing up on their website: Nutritionix Developer Portal.
    Replace the placeholders NUTRI_APP_ID and NUTRI_APP_KEY in the code with your actual API credentials.
    Run the program using a Python interpreter: python exercise_tracker.py.

TODO This is a list of tasks to be completed:

    Update the program to handle user authentication.
    Implement error handling and exception handling for API requests.
    Add functionality to edit existing workout entries.
    Improve the user interface by adding color-coding or formatting to the printed tables.
    Implement data validation for user input to ensure accurate exercise tracking.
    Add the ability to calculate and display total calories burned for a given date range.
    Implement a feature to export workout data to other file formats such as Excel or JSON.
    Write unit tests to ensure the code is functioning correctly.
    Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
    Update the readme file with detailed instructions and examples for running the program.

nutrinix api provides many other data apart from the health one so be free to use their appi to change the table and use it in your way>

STAY HEALTY!
